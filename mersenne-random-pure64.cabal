synopsis:        Generate high quality pseudorandom numbers purely using a Mersenne Twister
description:
    The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed by
    Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear
    recurrence over a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation
    of very high quality pseudorandom numbers
    .
    This library provides a purely functional binding to the 64 bit
    classic mersenne twister, along with instances of RandomGen, so the
    generator can be used with System.Random. The generator should
    typically be a few times faster than the default StdGen (but much
    slower than the impure 'mersenne-random' based on SIMD and
    destructive updates.
